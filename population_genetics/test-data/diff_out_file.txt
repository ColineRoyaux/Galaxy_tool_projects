Exact test of population genetic differentiation : 

Performed on  52 individuals of 6 different haplotypes sampled in 6 populations. 

p-value = 0.000499750124937531 

Significative test under 1%, haplotype composition is likely different between populations !
However, check for potential bias in your data before making any conclusion.
